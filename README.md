# Causal-Inference-on-Diabetes-Diagnosis-and-HbA1c-NHANES-
This project estimates the causal effect of diabetes diagnosis on glycemic control (HbA1c levels) using nationally representative data from the NHANES survey. We apply advanced causal inference methods (including PSM, IPTW, and regression adjustment) to reduce bias and estimate counterfactual outcomes.
